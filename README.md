**`M.S Student in Industrial & Systems Engineering`**
**`Data Engineering | Business Intelligence | Data Science | Analytics`**

Back in 2020, I found myself bored amidst the pandemicğŸ¦  and decided to help a friend choose his next college destination. I started pulling data into an Excel sheet manually, following tutorials on youtubeğŸ“¼. It was then that a SQL course ad caught my attention, marking the beggining of this journeyğŸ’».

A few months later, I changed my major from Civil EngineeringğŸ‘· to Information Systems & AnaltyicsğŸ“ˆ, graduated in Dec 2022, and am currently continuing my studies doing my MS in Systems EngineeringğŸ§®, expected to graduate in 2025.

I have solid foundations in Data EngineeringğŸª–, Data ScienceğŸª–, BI & AnalyticsğŸª– through my university coursework, professional experience, and portfolio projects (mostly related to my passion: footballâš½)
